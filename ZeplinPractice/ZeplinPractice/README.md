#### Objective
We need to implement the next iteration of the Stash Coach feature.  First step is to display to the user a list of achievements they can reach.  

#### Implementation
Implement the Achievements list screen using the VIPER architecture.  You can use any other tools/frameworks you deem necessary.

#### Design
The design for the new achievements screen can be found here. [Zeplin](https://scene.zeplin.io/project/5a5f7e1b4f9f24b874e0f19f/screen/5a60bbcacf6165237301ee21)
<br>_Note: do not include the images from the Zeplin project directly in your project._

#### Data
The sample data you need to retrieve/display can be found in the included _achievements.json_ file.  Please use this file in the challenge, but implement the challenge without needing an actual backend server.

#### Criteria
Some of the criteria that we take into account when we look at your code:
  - Knowledge of the platform/language patterns and idioms + ability to use them efficiently
  - Ability to write clean, non-over-engineered, testable, and extensible code
  - Ability to make smart architectural decisions and handle trade-offs
  - Ability to stick to the given requirements/design
